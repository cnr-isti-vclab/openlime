/* Here we have the primitives to edit SVG annotation, but we don't handle events

1) create a box: mouse down - drag - mouse up -> create element with handles
                 click - (cancel) click -> same

2) in case we can import an existing annotation, work and export the result

3) support for circle, straight line, text, curves, eraser etc.
