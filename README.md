We introduce **OpenLIME** (*Open Layered IMage Explorer*), an open, scalable, and flexible framework for creating web-based interactive tools to annotate and inspect large multi-layered and multi-channel standard and relightable image models. 

**OpenLIME** is jointly developed by [CRS4 Visual and Data-intensive Computing Group](https://www.crs4.it/en/research-and-development-sectors/vidic/) and [CNR ISTI - Visual Computing Lab](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/). 

**OpenLIME** is released as an open-source JavaScript library for the efficient display of scalable, high-resolution relightable images, and is accompanied by back-office tools to facilitate data preparation.

**OpenLIME** natively supports RGB images, multispectral images, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), and Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) datasets. It can be extended (and has been extended!) to accommodate other multi-channel raster datasets, such as neural representations. Common web image types (*jpg*, *png*, *gif*, etc...), as well as the most common multi-resolution image formats (*deepzoom*, *zoomify*, *IIIF*, *google maps*), can be used directly or composed to support more complex formats. 

Adaptive image management and display use a data-flow approach, where images from sources of any size are efficiently streamed into screen-sized buffers that can be processed and combined using customizable WebGL shaders. 

Multi-layer and multi-faceted visualizations are achieved through opacity adjustments, blending modes, and interactive lenses. 

The released library provides a set of pre-configured layers, facilitating the rapid deployment of web-based datasets and kiosk applications. Its responsive user interface is compatible with desktop, mobile, and general multitouch environments, while its modular architecture allows for extensive customization, making it adaptable to diverse annotation and visualization needs. 

**OpenLime** has already been used for a variety of specific use cases (see references below), including the inspection of RTI models, the integration of novel relightable image formats, archaeological data documentation and annotation, and creation and deployment of standalone museum applications. 

The released library contains a convenient set of examples that can be used both to understand how the library works and as a starting point for programming with **OpenLIME** itself.

## Using OpenLIME in your project

### Via CDN (recommended for quick start)

The easiest way to use OpenLIME is via a CDN like unpkg or jsdelivr:

```html
<!-- Using unpkg -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/openlime@1.2.2/dist/css/skin.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/openlime@1.2.2/dist/css/light.css">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/openlime@1.2.2/dist/js/openlime.min.js"></script>

<!-- OR using jsdelivr -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/openlime@1.2.2/dist/css/skin.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/openlime@1.2.2/dist/css/light.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/openlime@1.2.2/dist/js/openlime.min.js"></script>
```

### Installing via npm

If you're using a build system like webpack or rollup:

```bash
npm install openlime
```

Then import it into your project:

#### ES Module (ESM)
```javascript
import * as OpenLIME from 'openlime';

// Or import specific components
import { Viewer, Layer, LayerImage } from 'openlime';
```

#### CommonJS (CJS)
```javascript
const OpenLIME = require('openlime');
```

#### UMD (in browser with module bundler)
```javascript
import OpenLIME from 'openlime';
```

### Basic Usage Example

Here's a simple example of how to create a viewer with a single image layer:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>OpenLIME Basic Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/openlime@1.2.2/dist/css/lime.css">
  <style>
    #viewer {
      width: 100%;
      height: 600px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="viewer"></div>

  <script src="https://unpkg.com/openlime@1.2.2/dist/js/openlime.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      // Create a viewer
      const viewer = new OpenLIME.Viewer('viewer', {
        prefetchBorder: 1,
        layout: 'basic'
      });

      // Create and add an image layer
      const imageLayer = new OpenLIME.LayerImage({
        id: 'base-image',
        layout: 'image',
        url: 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
      });
      
      viewer.addLayer(imageLayer);
      
      // Add pan/zoom controller
      const controller = new OpenLIME.ControllerPanZoom();
      viewer.addController(controller);
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

For multi-resolution images:

```javascript
// Using a DeepZoom image
const deepZoomLayer = new OpenLIME.LayerImage({
  id: 'deepzoom-image',
  layout: 'deepzoom',
  url: 'path/to/your/deepzoom_files/'
});

// Using a Zoomify image
const zoomifyLayer = new OpenLIME.LayerImage({
  id: 'zoomify-image',
  layout: 'zoomify',
  url: 'path/to/your/zoomify/'
});

// Using an IIIF image
const iiifLayer = new OpenLIME.LayerImage({
  id: 'iiif-image',
  layout: 'iiif',
  url: 'https://your-iiif-server.org/your-image-id'
});
```

## Development Setup

### Installing npm

#### Arch Linux / Manjaro

```bash
sudo pacman -S npm
```

#### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install npm
```

##### Ubuntu 18.04
You might have some problem using the old npm version shipped with Ubuntu18.04, and even upgrading it. This worked for us:
```bash
sudo npm install -g npm@latest-6
```

#### Windows
To obtain npm for Windows, you need to download the Windows version of node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ . You can download either the Windows Installer (.msi) or the Windows Binary (.zip).  If you download  and expand the Windows Binary zip file, you will afterwards need to set your `PATH` variable to include the directory that contains the npm executable (this directory is the subdirectory `node_modules\npm\bin`).

## Setting up npm (all platforms)

The following step should be performed in the `openlime` directory that was cloned from this repository.

Before using npm, you need to install the required  packages locally. This only needs to be done once. The following command tells npm to download all the webpack packages (and their dependencies) listed in the `package.json` file.  These will be put in the `./node_modules` directory.

```bash
npm install
```

The downloaded packages include `rollup`, `documentation`,
and `nodemon`, which will be used below.
 
## Using npm (all platforms)

These steps should be performed in the `openlime` directory that was cloned from this repository.

### Build the code

The following command reads the javascript code in `./src`, and puts the transpiled webpack code in `./dist/main.js`.
```bash
npm run build
```

The webpack code is used, for example, by the
`./dist/index.html` web page.

### Run the node.js server

If you wish, you can run the node.js development server to serve your web pages. This server will use `./dist` as the home directory. The server is run in "hot" mode, which means that whenever you change a file in the `./src` directory, the webpack code will automatically be rebuilt. Your web browser will automatically refresh to reflect your latest changes.
```bash
npm run start
```

Then access the demo app at http://localhost:8080 (which, by default, is `./dist/index.html`).

If you prefer to serve from a different port, say 8088, you can call
```bash
npm run start -- --port 8088
```

### Create a rollup file to use with other servers

To create a rollup file that can be used with other servers, you don't need to rely on Node.js as the server. Instead, you can embed the rollup file directly in your web page using the `<script>` tag. You can reference either `./dist/js/openlime.min.js` or `./dist/js/openlime.js`.

In the `./dist/examples` folder, you'll find simple **openLIME** web apps that demonstrate how to use this approach. These files will display correctly when served from any web server.

To generate the rollup files, run the following command:
```bash
npm run rollup
```

### Keep the rollup files up to date

If you keep a `nodemon` (**node** **mon**itor) script running, it
will automatically update the rollup files
`./dist/js/openlime.min.js`
and 
`./dist/js/openlime.js` 
whenever anything changes in the `./src` directory. Note that, unlike with the node.js server, the browser will not refresh automatically; you will have to do that yourself once the rollup files have been updated.

```bash
npm run nodemon
```

### Create documentation

The documentation is created from structured comments in the source code (in `./src`). Once created, it is accessible from `./docs/index.html`

```bash
npm run doc
```

### Customization

skin.css

skin.svg

Run 
```bash
svgo -p 1 skin.svg -o skin.min.svg
```
to minimize svg.


Documentation.js supports markdown syntax and JSDoc syntax.



JSON example of the configuration:


```
{
	camera: { 
	},
	canvas: {
		rasters: [
			{
				id:
				name:
				width: //optional
				height: //optional
				url: 
				layout: <image|google|deepzoom|zoomify|iip|iiif> //optional if can be determined from the url.
				

			}
		]
	},
	overlay: {
	}
}
```
